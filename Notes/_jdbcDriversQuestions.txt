*   What is driver software in JDBC ?

>>  A group of implementation classes of JDBC interface is called driver software which is identified by Driver class (class which provide
    implementation of driver interface).

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   How many types of drivers are there ?

>>  Based on functionality and architecture, all the drivers are classified into 4 types.

    (1) Type-1 Driver :

        also known as

        - JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver or
        - Bridge Driver

    (2) Type-2 Driver :

        also known as

        - Native API - Partly Java Driver or
        - Native Driver

    (3) Type-3 Driver :

        also known as

        - All Java Net Protocol Driver or
        - Network Protocol Driver or
        - Middleware Driver

    (4) Type-4 Driver :

        also known as

        - All Java Native Protocol Driver or
        - Pure java Driver
        - Thin Driver

*   Explain Type-1 Driver.

>>  Type-1 driver converts JDBC calls into ODBC calls and vice versa. It acts as a bridge between Java application and
    ODBC. That's why it's also known as JDBC-ODBC bridge driver or bridge driver.

    It doesn't communicate directly with database. Instead, it takes support of ODBC to communicate with DB.

    It is not recommended to use this Driver.

        JAVA Appication   ===>   Type-1 Driver   ===>   ODBC Driver   ===>   Database
                                       or
                                  Bridge Driver

    Pros :

    (1) We are not required to install it seperately as it is available as the part of JDK
    (2) As it doesn't communicate directly with DB, it is DB independent Driver

    Cons :

    (1) It is slowest Driver as first it converts JDBC calls to ODBC calls and then ODBC will convert it to DB specific
        calls.
    (2) As it uses ODBC which only supports Windows platform, this Driver is platform dependent Driver

*   Explain Type-2 Driver.

>>  Type-2 Driver is similar to Type-1 Driver execpt there is only change i.e. ODBC Driver is replaced with Vendor
    provided database specific native languages mostly in C or C++. Due to which we have to install this library into
    client machine.

    Type-2 Driver converts JDBC calls to vendor specific database native library calls which can be understood by
    database.

    JAVA Appication   ===>   Type-2 Driver   ===>   Database vendor specific   ===>   Database
                                    or                  native libraries
                             Native Driver

    Pros :

    (1) There is no need of ODBC Driver
    (2) It is applicable to multiple platform as there is no ODBC Driver required.

    Cons :

    (1) It is platform dependent driver. On the change of platform, we have to change the Driver.
    (2) It is database dependent driver. On the change of database, we have to change the Driver.

*   Explain Type-3 Driver.

>>  Type -3 Driver JDBC is also known as Network Protocol Driver as it uses an application server that converts JDBC
    calls directly or indirectly into the vendor-specific database protocol.

    This driver translates JDBC calls into the middleware vendorâ€™s protocol, which is then converted to a
    database-specific protocol by the middleware server software that provides connectivity to many databases.

    JAVA Appication   ===>          Type-3 Driver        ===>    Middleware server  ===>   Database
                                       or
                                Network Protocol Driver

    Pros :

    (1) It is platform independent
    (2) It is database independent as middleware server will communicate with the database

    Cons :

    (1) It needs database specific code on middleware server

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

*   Explain Type-4 Driver.

>>  This Driver uses Database specific native protocols to communicate with the database.

    It converts JDBC calls to database specific calls directly which makes it faster than other Drivers.

    JAVA Appication   ===>   Type-4 Driver    ===>   Database
                                    or
                            Pure java Driver

    Pros :

    (1) It is platform independent Driver.
    (2) It uses database specific native protocols to communicate with the database hence security is more.

    Cons :

    (1) It is database dependent driver. On the change of database, we have to change the Driver.
