*   What are BLOB and CLOB ?

>>  BLOB and CLOB are data types used to store large volumes of data, such as binary data (BLOB) or text data (CLOB).
    Here's what they stand for and how they are typically used:

    (1) BLOB (Binary Large Object):

        BLOB stands for "Binary Large Object".

        It is a database data type used to store binary data, such as images, audio, video, or any other type of binary
        file.

        BLOBs can store a wide range of binary data, and their size can vary from small to very large.

        Examples of BLOB data include images in a photo database, audio files in a music database, or documents in a
        document management system.

    (2) CLOB (Character Large Object):

        CLOB stands for "Character Large Object".

        It is a database data type used to store large amounts of text data, typically in character encoding formats
        like UTF-8 or UTF-16.

        CLOBs are used to store text-based data, such as long articles, documents, or textual data that exceeds the
        capacity of standard VARCHAR or TEXT columns.

        CLOBs are suitable for storing textual data that requires extensive search and indexing capabilities.

*   What are the steps to insert BLOB into DB ?

>>  Following are the steps to insert BLOB into DB :

    (1) Create File object to represent Binary file.

        ```
            File file = new File("abc.jpg");
        ```

    (2) Create FileInputStream to read Binary file.

        ```
            FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
        ```

    (3) Create PreparedStatement to execute the insert query. We can use simple Statement object also for inserting but
        in that approach, first we have to convert Binary file into Hexadecimal string format which is a tedious task.
        Moreover, simple Statement is prone to SQL injection. Keeping all this in mind, it's better to use
        PreparedStatement.

        ```
            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = new connection.prepareStatement("Insert INTO person VALUES (?, ?)");
        ```

    (4) Pass the FileInputStream as a parameter value to the PreparedStatement and execute the PreparedStatement.

        ```
            preparedStatement.setBinaryStream(2, inputStream);
            preparedStatement.executeUpdate();
        ```

*   What are the steps to retrieve BLOB from DB ?

>>  Following are the steps to retrieve BLOB from DB :

    (1) Create PreparedStatement and execute the select query. We can use simple Statement object also in this case.

        ```
            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = new connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM person");
        ```

    (2) Get the InputStream from the ResultSet that is being retrieved.

        ```
            InputStream inputStream = resultSet.getBinaryStream(2);
        ```

    (3) Create File object to represent Binary file where you want to store the file.

        ```
            File file = new File("abc.jpg");
        ```

    (4) Create FileOutputStream to write Binary file.

        ```
            FileOutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream(file);
        ```

    (5) Read the binary file from the InputStream and write it to file using OutputStream.

        ```
            int data;
            while ((data = inputStream.read()) != -1) {
                outputStream.write(data);
            }
        ```

                outputStream.write(data);
            }
        ```

*   What is the need of buffer while inserting or reading large object ?

>>  Let say we want to read/write 10KB of data i.e. equal to 10 * (1024) Byte of data.

    (1) Without using buffer :

        -----------------                   -----------------
        |               |                   |               |
        |     10KB      |------------------>|               |
        |     data      |<------------------|               |
        |               |                   |               |
        -----------------                   -----------------
            source                              destination

        10KB = 10 * (1024) = 10240 Byte data

        To read/write 10KB of data, total of 10240 read/write operation is required which will impact the overall
        performance

    (2) Using buffer :

        -----------------             ------------             -----------------
        |               |             |          |             |               |
        |     10KB      |------------>|   1KB    |------------>|               |
        |     data      |<------------|  Buffer  |<------------|               |
        |               |             |          |             |               |
        -----------------             ------------             -----------------
            source                       Buffer                   destination

        10KB = 10 * (1024) = 10240 Byte data
        1KB = 1024 Byte of Buffer

        To read/write 10KB of data, total of 10240/(Buffer size) = 10 read/write operation is required which will
        improve the performance
